<h1>Technology Used</h1>

<h2>HTML | CSS </h2>
I wanted the game board to be a simple grid style so I could detect collisions correctly. Part of why I chose Bob's Burgers as the theme is that I knew that transparent images of characters would be readily available. These are all sized based off of the grid size. 


<h2>jQuery | JavaScript </h2>

I knew I wanted to incorporate jQuery to make the game more interactive and add the arcade functionality of moving a character around a game board. The grid was created using a for loop with JavaScript and jQuery appending squares.


<h1>Challenges</h1>

The biggest challenge with this game was getting the collision detection to work correctly. I went through several iterations of the code to detect collision. It would either fire at the wrong times or not at all. Ultimately I was able to create a series of if checks so that the detection fired when it was supposed to.
